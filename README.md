# Internal Tools

This is an [nx](./notes/nx.md) scaffolded monorepo to facilitate development of internal internal tools where each app can share [libs](./libs/).

## Readme and me

[apps](./apps/) and [libs](./libs/) each have their own readme.

## Help

- [node.js subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/node/)
- [Nodeiflux discord community server](https://disboard.org/server/425824580918181889)
- [TypeScript discord community server](https://discord.com/invite/typescript)
- [Total TypeScript Guide](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tutorials/beginners-typescript)
- [TypeScript type challenges video solutions](https://youtu.be/knOgB-Aa8Pc)
- and of course stack overflow, but the above are often faster to respond
- For quick testing, [TypeScript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/) and [Code Sandbox's TypeScript Node Template](https://codesandbox.io/s/) when you need to install packages is great.
