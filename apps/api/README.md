# Api App

This express server api is to contain models and CRUD operations that potentially multiple internal apps can consume via the [shared api data-access lib](../../libs/shared/api/data-access/).

## Needs improvement

The vertical slice / feature slice (see base readme for more info) pattern followed in the express app could probably be improved. I couldn't find a direct example of it.
